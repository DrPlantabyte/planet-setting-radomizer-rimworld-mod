# Dr. Plantabyte's Planet Setting Randomizer
This lightweight mod causes the rainfall, temperature, population, and pollution sliders to default to a specific combination based on your world's seed text. You can still manually adjust the sliders to whatever you want.

This mod works well with [Random Factions]().
