# Dr. Plantabyte's Planet Setting Randomizer
![Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1922739/209423285-ad4d91eb-4ff2-4d5d-8661-cb5dbf205820.png)

This lightweight mod causes the rainfall, temperature, population, and pollution sliders to default to a specific combination based on your world's seed text. You can still manually adjust the sliders to whatever you want.

This mod works well with [Random Factions]().
